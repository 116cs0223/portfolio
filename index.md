The objective of this project is to leverage the power of supervised machine learning capacity of 
Artificial Neural Network to gain human level intelligenece to solve real world problem. In this project, I have taken
the popular yet realitvely simple game Tic-Tac-Toe which is typically played between 2 human players.
In this game, we have planned 
1. To create the game using python tkinter library
2. to play games manually many times 
3. to create a dataset with high quality from it
4. Then to feed this to train ANN brain
5. In the end, to let the trained ANN play gainst a human brain

The objective of this project is to analyze information about past loan applicants of a Consumer 
Finance Company, using EDA to identify patterns which indicate if a person is 
likely to default. 
The company can further utilise this knowledge of driving factors behind loan 
defaults for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## Training and Learning

### SQL-Training

SQL is a very common lanuage used in many relational databases like MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL, Ingress and many more. There should be a consolidated learning for freshers to understand the syntax of this language. This training repository is planned to ramp-up freshers who are just starting their IT carrier or for leareers who are interested in knowing this language.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
